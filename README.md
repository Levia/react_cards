### React project

**Intructions**

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Go to `localhost:3000` unless different port specified

**Assumptions**

* Sort already fetched elements rather than asking the json server again with a reverse order.
* Simple layout as per wireframes.

**Difficulties encountered**

* I first used a very simplified grid layout with 'rows' of 3 cards. I have used custom functions to group cards in array of 3 elements but it didn't go well with the sorting functionality as a bug showed up breaking the layout.
* I found lazy loading quicker to implement and it was also the preferred solution to properly display spinners on loading.
